    description:"Dimples are small depressions in the skin that appear when smiling. These indentations can enhance someoneâ€™s features and are often desired to create a more attractive facial contour. Natural dimples are apparent at birth and are caused by a slight deformity in the cheek muscle where the skin is tethered to the zygomaticus major muscle. When an individual smiles, the fibrous connection causes the dimple to become deeper and more visible. This tethering can be mimicked surgically during a dimpleplasty procedures. For those with prominent cheekbones looking for a dramatic reshaping of the face, a cheekbone reduction surgery may be better suited. Before the dimpleplasty procedure, the surgeon will mark the areas on the surface of the cheeks for where the new dimples will be. Once the location is agreed upon, local anesthesia will be applied to ensure comfort for the patient. A small incision will be made on the inside of the cheek. An absorbable suture will be passed through the inside of the cheek to catch the undersurface of the skin where the dimple is desired. Once the suture is tied, a depression will form on the overlying skin. After surgery the dimple will be present even without smiling. Eventually, the dimple will only fade and only be present when moving the face. The suture will cause scarring between the cheek and cheek muscle so that even when the suture has dissolved, the scar tissue will act as the fibrous connection and create the superficial indentation when smiling. The goal of a dimpleplasty is to create the appearance of dimples.",

          "You can go back to work or resume regular activities two days after the procedure. The surgeon will set up a follow-up appointment a few weeks later to check the results. In general, recovery takes about 2 weeks, but it may take a couple of months to see the full results.",
