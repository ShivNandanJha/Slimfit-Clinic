      "In general, a face-lift involves elevating the skin and tightening the underlying tissues and muscles. Fat in the face and neck may be sculpted, removed or redistributed. Facial skin is then re-draped over the newly repositioned contours of the face, excess skin is removed, and the wound is stitched or taped closed. The incisions for the procedure depend on the techniques that will be used and the patient’s preferences. Options include:A traditional face-lift incision starts at your temples in the hairline, continues down and around the front of your ears and ends behind your ears in your lower scalp. An incision might be made under your chin to improve the appearance of your neck.A limited incision is a shorter incision that begins in your hairline just above your ear, wraps around the front of your ear, but does not extend all the way into the lower scalp.Neck lift incision starts in front of your earlobe and continues around your ear into your lower scalp. A small incision also is made under your chin.A face-lift generally takes two to four hours but might take longer if other cosmetic procedures are done at the same time.",
