    description:
      "A mastopexy is performed under general anesthesia or intravenous sedation in a hospital, free standing surgical center or surgeonâ€™s office equipped with a surgical suite. Different techniques for removing breast skin and reshaping the breast determine the location of the incisions and resulting scars. Your surgeon will select a technique based on your breast size and shape, areola size and position, degree of breast sagging, skin quality and elasticity and how much extra skin you have. Your plastic surgeon will remove excess breast skin and shift the nipple and areola to a higher position.If your areola has become stretched, it can now be reduced in size.Skin that was formerly located above the areola is brought down and together, beneath the breast, to reshape the breast.Your surgeon will remove excess skin and close your incisions, tightening the skin, sewing the breast back together and placing sutures deep in the breast tissue to support the new breast position for a longer period of time.Scars are usually hidden under the breasts, although some light scarring may be seen on top of the breast.The nipples and areolas remain attached to underlying mounds of tissue, and this usually allows for the preservation of sensation and the ability to breastfeed.In some patients, it may be possible to avoid the horizontal incision beneath the breast as well as the vertical incision that runs from the bottom edge of the areola to the breast crease. If you are a good candidate for a modified technique, your plastic surgeon will discuss this with you.",

AFTERCARE: In the case of a breast lift, ice is not the solution for pain and swelling. Avoid ice packs as they can decrease vital blood flow to your incisions",
